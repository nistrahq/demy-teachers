# Code of Conduct

Available languages:  
- [English](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

This project is the **Flutter mobile application** of the **Demy** project, developed by a **closed team** of collaborators.  
The purpose of this code is to ensure a respectful, organized, and professional working environment throughout the development of the app.

## 1. Respect and Communication
- Treat all team members with respect and professionalism.  
- Resolve disagreements constructively and focus on solutions.  
- Use the official team communication channels (e.g., Discord, WhatsApp, Slack).  
- Provide feedback that is clear, actionable, and supportive.  

---

## 2. Responsibility and Commitment
- Deliver assigned tasks and features within agreed deadlines.  
- Test your work locally using `flutter run`, `flutter test`, or widget tests before submitting.  
- Notify the team in advance if you cannot meet a deadline or if blockers appear.  
- Take ownership of your contributions and fix issues that arise from them.

## 3. Collaboration
- Review others’ contributions with a supportive and improvement-oriented mindset.  
- Follow the structure defined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) (modules in `lib/`, shared code in `core/`, assets in `assets/`).  
- Respect naming conventions, commit message standards, and branching workflow (`feature/`, `develop`, `main`).  
- Avoid uploading unnecessary, duplicate, or generated files (e.g., `/build`, `.dart_tool`, or IDE metadata).  

---

## 4. Work Quality
- Ensure code is clean, readable, and consistent with **Dart/Flutter best practices** (use `dart format` and `flutter analyze`).  
- Verify accessibility (a11y) and internationalization (i18n) when modifying the UI.  
- Write documentation clearly (comments, README updates, usage guides).  
- Double-check spelling, formatting, and screenshots before committing or opening a Pull Request.  
- Keep diagrams, architecture documents, and exported assets synchronized with their sources.  

---

## 5. Enforcement
This code applies to all members of the Flutter team.  
Failure to follow these guidelines will be discussed within the group and resolved by consensus.  
Repeated disregard of the Code of Conduct may lead to restrictions on participation in the project.  

---

## 6. Security
- Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly in Issues or Pull Requests.  
- Follow the process described in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) to report them privately.
