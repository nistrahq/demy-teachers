## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please **do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly** in Issues or Pull Requests.

Instead, report them privately to the maintainers:

When reporting, please include:

- The **Flutter application codebase** (Dart, Flutter SDK, provider/BLoC state management, etc.).  
- App configurations, `pubspec.yaml` dependencies, and environment files.
