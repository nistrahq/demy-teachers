# CODEOWNERS file
# ----------------
# This file defines the default code owners for the repository.
# A code owner is automatically requested for review when someone opens
# a pull request that modifies the files they own.
#
# In this initial setup, we are keeping it simple:
# every developer listed below is considered a global owner of the codebase.
#
# What this means:
# - Whenever a pull request is opened, GitHub will automatically notify
#   all the developers listed here and request their review.
# - This ensures visibility: every teammate is aware of changes in the repo.
#
# Important:
# - This file by itself does NOT block merges.
# - A pull request can still be merged without review or approval,
#   unless branch protection rules are enabled in GitHub settings.
# - If in the future we want to enforce mandatory reviews, we can update
#   the branch protection rules to require one or more approvals.
#
# Global owners (applies to all files and directories in the repo):
